This repository contains Study to predict pollution peaks in Madrid city as part of a TFM for 2sd edition of Data Scientist Master Streaming 2021-2022 by KSCHOOL


# Business Problem

The objective of this study is to elaborate a method that can predict pollution peaks in Madrid city, identifying variables impacting on NO2 index

WHY.  
Pollutions peaks in Madrid are triggering traffic restrictions that can have an impact on the normal traffic flow in the city, disturbing business and citizens activities.
In addition pollutions peaks have an impact on the health of the weakest or most vulnerable Madrid citizens,  so being capable to predict these episodes government could send recommendations to vulnerable population, trying to prevent the impact.

HOW. Creation of a prediction model capable to predict episodes of max pollution(based on NO2 index) 2 days in advance applying different machine learning (ML) techniques, calculating the probability to reach high pollution episodes

BONUS. 
Analysis of the impact of traffic restrictions in the traffic congestion index.
Analysis of pollution impact in the citizens live per district.
